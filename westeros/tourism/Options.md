## Options pattern 
Uses classes to provide strongly typed access to groups of related settings. When configuration settings are isolated by scenario into separate classes, the app adheres to two important software engineering principles:

ยบ The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) or Encapsulation: Scenarios (classes) that depend on configuration settings depend only on the configuration settings that they use.

ยบ Separation of Concerns: Settings for different parts of the app aren't dependent or coupled to one another.
