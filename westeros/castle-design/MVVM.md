## Model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) 
Is a software architectural pattern that facilitates the separation of the development of the graphical user interface (the view) – be it via a markup language or GUI code – from the development of the business logic or back-end logic (the model) so that the view is not dependent on any specific model platform. The viewmodel of MVVM is a value converter,[1] meaning the viewmodel is responsible for exposing (converting) the data objects from the model in such a way that objects are easily managed and presented. In this respect, the viewmodel is more model than view, and handles most if not all of the view's display logic.[1] The viewmodel may implement a mediator pattern, organizing access to the back-end logic around the set of use cases supported by the view.
