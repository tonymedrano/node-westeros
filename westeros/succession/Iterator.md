## Iterator Pattern 
Is a relatively simple and frequently used design pattern. There are a lot of data structures/collections available in every language. Each collection must provide an iterator that lets it iterate through its objects. 

The code is easier to use, understand and test since the iterator uses the Single Responsibility and Open/Closed SOLID principles. The Single Responsibility Principle allows us to clean up the client and collections of the traversal algorithms. The Open/Closed SOLID principle allows us to add new traversal algorithms without having to change the client code.
